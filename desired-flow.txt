Agent flow
1) User inputs --> topic and country, for example: climate change/USA
2) the agent searches for top communications media in that country (for now just 4 media), presents them to the user and ask if they want to continue generating an inform. The agent has to provide info in what he based its selection of the media
3) if the user says no, agent ask if they wanna change topic/location or keep it the same and repeat step 2.
4) if the user says yes it's starts analyzing the topic in each media. Also present to the user which news it analyzed
5) present a structured inform
6) ask if they wanna add an extra media to compare.
7) if user says no, finish
8) if the user says yes and passes a media --> check if that media information is available, if yes, proceed searching for the topic
9) add it to the inform and compare in detail how that new media compares with the others in the approach

the inform should be presented as a table (for numerica values) and can also be text when wanting to provide internal insights. It would also be intresting to answer this questions:
   - What's consensus vs controversial?
   - How does framing differ?
   - What's included/excluded by whom regading to that topic?

In the report do a:
   - Source-by-source breakdown
   - Comparative analysis
   - Citations/links
